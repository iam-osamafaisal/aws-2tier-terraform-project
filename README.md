## 🧩 Architecture Overview

**Components Used:**
- **VPC** — custom network with public & private subnets  
- **EC2 Instance** — application server (web/app tier)  
- **RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL)** — database server (database tier)  
- **Security Groups** — tier-wise network isolation  
- **IAM Role** — for instance-level access control  
- **Key Pair** — for secure SSH access  

🧾 Summary

This project demonstrates how to deploy and manage a scalable 2-Tier Web Application on AWS using Terraform.
It follows real-world best practices like Infrastructure as Code (IaC), modular design, and secure network configuration.
